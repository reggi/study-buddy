# Study Buddy

The idea is that it would be nice to know someone that is learning the same thing you are, so you can share knowlege. I'm not sure the best way to organize this repo. Should it just be issues? Should it be pull requests? How should people be paired? 

Ideally the topic someone is "studying" can be anthing, right now I'm learning react and flux. `reactjs.md` and `flux.md` could be files in the root of this repo. Ideally people were connected through some sort of moderator, IDK.
